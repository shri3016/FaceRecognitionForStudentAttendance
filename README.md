# FaceRecognitionForStudentAttendance

**Overview:**

This project aims to automate the process of student attendance management using facial recognition technology. By integrating facial detection algorithms with a web application and a mobile app, administrators and teachers can efficiently track and manage student attendance.

**Features:**

**Facial Detection and Recognition:** Utilizes state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms to detect, extract features, and classify student faces for attendance tracking.

**Real-time Attendance Tracking:** Provides real-time attendance updates to administrators and teachers for effective monitoring.

**Web Interface for Admins:** Allows administrators to add, edit, and manage information for admins, teachers, and students.

**Mobile App for Teachers:** Enables teachers to create and mark attendance for their classes using a mobile application.

**Facial Recognition Algorithms:**

**MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks):**
MTCNN is employed for detecting and localizing student faces within captured images from the integrated camera. It accurately identifies faces under varying conditions and orientations.

**FaceNet:**
FaceNet is utilized for facial feature extraction and embedding generation. It creates embeddings for each detected face, representing its unique features in a high-dimensional space.

**SVM (Support Vector Machine):**

SVM is used for face classification based on the embeddings generated by FaceNet. It learns to classify new faces into predefined student classes with high accuracy.
